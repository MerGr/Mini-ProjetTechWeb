				<p>The story begins in the late 1970s when Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded Apple.<br>
					The success of the Apple II computer provided the company with a strong foundation, but Jobs envisioned a more accessible and user-friendly computing experience.<br>
					This vision led to the successor, the Apple Lisa, in 1982, which featured a Graphical User Interface rather than the command line interfaces accustomed to by the market. But lack of software support and high costs led to poor sales especially compared to the widely popular IBM PC. But Apple still had a trick up its sleeve.<br>
				</p>	
				
				<img src="media/mac128kproto.jpg" class="media hidden right zero" loading="lazy"/> <br>

				<p>The Macintosh project aimed to create a complete low-cost computer that would follow the Lisa&rsquo;s vision. The project faced numerous challenges, chiefly the internal conflicts between Jef Raskin and Steve Jobs for the control on the project. With the latter gaining majority power at the end. <br>
					The breakthrough came with the creation of the Macintosh 128K, which was officially launched on January 24, 1984. This computer featured a revolutionary graphical interface and introduced the concepts of icons, windows, and popularized the mouse, making it easier for users to interact with the machine. However, the original Macintosh System Software (later known as Classic Mac OS) was not without its limitations. <br>

			<h1 class="one hidden">System 1.0</h1>
			<div class="txtcontent one hidden">
				<p>System 1, officially known as &quot;System Software 1.0,&quot; was the first operating system for the original Macintosh computer. It was released on January 24, 1984, alongside the launch of the Macintosh 128K. System 1 marked a significant milestone in the history of personal computing, introducing a revolutionary graphical user interface (GUI) that departed from the command-line interfaces of its contemporaries.<br></p>
				
				<img src="media/system1desktop.png" class="media hidden right one" loading="lazy"/>

				<p>
					System 1 featured a groundbreaking graphical interface that made use of icons, windows, and a mouse. This departure from command-line interfaces made computing more accessible to a broader audience. Users could interact with the Macintosh by pointing and clicking, rather than relying on text commands.<br>
					One of the defining features of System 1 was the desktop metaphor. The desktop displayed icons representing files and folders, providing users with a visual representation of their digital workspace. This metaphor has endured and remains a fundamental aspect of modern operating systems.<br>
				</p>

				<video class="media hidden left one" loading="lazy" controls>
					<source src="media/mac84ad.mp4" type="video/mp4">

				</video>

				<p>
					The System 1 included the Finder, a file management application that allowed users to navigate through files and folders using the graphical interface. The Finder played a crucial role in shaping the Macintosh user experience.<br>
					System 1 came bundled with several built-in applications, including MacWrite and MacPaint. MacWrite was a word processing application, while MacPaint allowed users to create and edit digital drawings. These applications showcased the capabilities of the Macintosh and demonstrated the potential of graphical computing.<br>
					It also had limited support for multitasking. While users could run multiple applications simultaneously, the system's capabilities were constrained compared to later versions of the Macintosh operating system.<br>
					System 1 was designed to run on the original Macintosh 128K, the first Macintosh model released by Apple. The hardware specifications of this early Macintosh included a Motorola 68000 processor running at 8 MHz, 128 KB of RAM, and a 400 KB floppy disk drive.<br>
				</p>

				<p>System 1 laid the foundation for the Macintosh operating system and established many conventions that would persist in subsequent versions. System 1 ushered in a revolution in GUI-based interactions and made many foundational designs in User Accessibility and Experience.</p>

				<p>Internal conflicts between Jobs and the rest of the board led to Jobs ousting from the company in September 1985. After the loss of the company he started, he founded NeXT; another software &amp; hardware company to continue his vision of the future of computing.</p>

				<p>Back at Apple, development for subsequent revisions of the Macintosh, and by association, System Software continued, with the introduction of System 2.0 in 1985 that introduced the LaserWriter and AppleTalk technologies, 2.1 introduced partial implementation of Hierarchical File System.<br>
				System 3.0, debuted with Macintosh Plus in 1986, fully incorporated HFS and tweaked the GUI.<br>

				<p>The first system update to be available in retail, System Software 5.0 brought in more stability and more features.<br>
					But the star of the show was the evolution of Finder. MultiFinder<br>
					A cooperative multitasking extension to Mac OS that allowed users to run multiple programs at once by giving computer resources to the background applications only if the foreground application yield power, guaranteeing full system resources for the active application, but it is more risky and dangerous if the app does not relinquish control due to bugs, poor programming or program hangs. A problem that will haunt Apple as it ventures into the 90s.<br>

				<p>It&rsquo;s 1988, and a new type of computing was born. Portable computing, the power of number crunching machines that can be taken from home to work. Apple would not let such an emerging new segment of the hardware market untouched. System 6.0 was made specifically to tailor to their offering, the Macintosh Portable.</p>

				<p>Sadly, many of what Apple released, be it software or hardware, did not see much growth compared to the behemoth that was IBM and Microsoft, the company was slowly bleeding.<br>

				<p>A huge leap forward, a herculean effort by Apple engineers to bring Apple from the cusp of irrelevancy, System Software 7.0 &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo;, released on May 13th 1991, revamped the user interface, baked in MultiFinder&rsquo;s cooperative multitasking feature deep into the OS&rsquo;s design, a move to 32-bit memory addressing, introduction of virtual memory support to improve system stability, streamlined extension support and a plethora of customization options.</p>

				<img src="media/system7.png" class="media hidden five right" loading="lazy" />

				<p>The user experience was made more efficient and seamless, AppleScript let users automate menial tasks easily, networking was massively overhauled to brace for the explosive World Wide Web.<br>
				Programs for creative professionals were also a huge selling point of the Macintosh, with support for fast 32-bit color imaging with the QuickDraw API, computer art never looked more beautiful.</p>

				<p>Subsequent updates were mostly hardware support for PowerPC and bugfixes.<br>
				System 7 was positively received by Apple customers, but it didn&rsquo;t grow as much as Apple hoped.</p>

				<p>System 7 brought Apple computers to near feature parity with its competitors, and the California-based company sought to a complete overhaul for it&rsquo;s next version, codenamed Copland.<br>

				<p>Starting development in 1988, Copland was Apple&rsquo;s next generation operating system, a PowerPC-first modern system, to claw the company back into stardom, but such high aspirations, makes the fall even more crushing.</p>

				<p>Copland was stuck in development hell, feature creep and system instability marred the project, Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows was changing the landscape faster than what Apple can match, the cooperative multitasking model proved unsustainable as programs become more complex.<br>
				Announced in 1994 with the introduction of the first PowerPC powered Macs, Copland was highly anticipated, which added to the pressure.<br>
				Shareholders growing more impatient, development lingered and the competition speeding away, major restructuring was in order, were in a bid for damage control, the new CEO halted all funding for the Copland project, as the codebase was deemed too broken to be repaired.<br> </p>

				<p>
				A hunt for a new operating system was underway as a last ditch effort to save Apple, from bankruptcy.<br>
				Talks with purchasing BeOS fell through. Mere weeks away from bankruptcy, Apple found it&rsquo;s savior from one of it&rsquo;s founding fathers.</p>

Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on &quot;under the hood&quot; changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser. Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1 GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).</p>

					<p>Snow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.</p>

						Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features visible to the user, including updates to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.</p>
						
						<p>The major change under the hood is the switch to the Apple File System, optimized for the solid-state storage used in most new Mac computers.<br>

				The trial was a protracted legal battle that spanned several years. Microsoft was accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices to maintain its monopoly in the operating system market. The case brought attention to issues of monopolistic behavior, product tying with hardware manufacturers, and the impact of Microsoft's actions on competition.</p>

				<p>Microsoft was facing the threat of being broken into smaller independent companies, but was narrowly overruled by appeals, on basis of bias by the judicial system.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, in 2001, Microsoft reached a settlement with the Department of Justice. The company agreed to modify its business practices and allow computer manufacturers more flexibility in the installation of software on Windows. The settlement aimed to promote competition and address concerns about Microsoft's dominance in the technology industry.</p>

				<p>The legal battles and regulatory scrutiny during this period left a lasting impact on its business practices and set precedents for future antitrust cases in the technology sector. The events surrounding the United States v. Microsoft case were emblematic of the broader challenges and ethical considerations that emerged as technology companies gained unprecedented influence in the global economy.<br></p>

					<p>Vista also included a built-in anti-spyware tool, Windows Defender, to enhance security against malicious software.<br>
					The Media Center capabilities were expanded, allowing users to manage and enjoy multimedia content more seamlessly.<br>
					</p>

					<p>
					Despite its innovative features, Windows Vista faced mixed reviews. The introduction of UAC was criticized for being intrusive, and there were concerns about hardware requirements. Compatibility issues with existing software and drivers also affected user experiences.</p>

					<p>While Windows Vista addressed security concerns, its performance on lower-end hardware led to user dissatisfaction. These challenges contributed to a slower adoption rate compared to its predecessor, Windows XP.</p>

					<p>To address user feedback and improve system stability, Microsoft released Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows Vista in 2008. SP1 included various updates, enhancements, and improvements to address performance issues.</p>

					<p>Windows Vista paved the way for the subsequent release of Windows 7 in 2009, which addressed many of the performance and compatibility issues.<br>

					While maintaining the User Account Control (UAC) introduced in Vista, Windows 7 implemented additional security measures to enhance system protection.<br>
					DirectAccess was also introduced in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions, it simplified remote access to corporate networks without the need for a traditional VPN.</p>

					<p>Windows 7 was met with widespread acclaim, in stark contrast to the mixed reception of Windows Vista. Users and businesses appreciated the improved performance, enhanced stability, and streamlined user interface. The positive reception led to a faster adoption rate, with many users transitioning from Windows XP and Vista to Windows 7.</p>

					<p>Windows 7 achieved remarkable market dominance, becoming one of the most widely used and beloved versions of Windows. Its success led to an extended support period, with Microsoft providing regular updates and security patches for an extended duration.</p>

					<p>Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows 7 was released in 2011, consolidating updates and introducing new features. Microsoft continued to release updates and patches to address security vulnerabilities and improve system reliability throughout the supported lifecycle of Windows 7.</p>

					<p>Despite its enduring popularity, Windows 7 eventually reached its end of extended support on January 14, 2020.

					<p>Released on October 26, 2012, Windows 8 represented a significant departure from traditional Windows interfaces. Microsoft aimed to create a unified operating system for both traditional desktops and touch-centric devices like tablets.<br>
					Windows 8 introduced the Microsoft Metro UI Design Language which focused on typography and simplified icons, absence of clutter, increased content to chrome ratio (&quot;content before chrome&quot;), and basic geometric shapes.<br>
					</p>

					<div class="blur eight right">
						<img src="media/metro.png" alt="Windows 8's Start Screen in metro design" class="media hidden right eight" loading="lazy"/>
					</div>

					<p>Windows 8 introduced the Start Screen, a tile-based interface designed for touch input. Live Tiles provided dynamic updates for apps directly on the Start Screen. A side menu called the Charms Bar provided quick access to essential functions like search, share, and settings.<br>
					Windows 8 also marked the introduction of the Windows Store, allowing users to download and install apps directly from Microsoft's curated marketplace. Users were encouraged to sign in with a Microsoft account for personalized settings synchronization across devices.</p>

					<p>While heavily promoting the touch-centric interface, Windows 8 retained a Desktop mode for traditional keyboard and mouse input.<br>
					</p>

					<div class="blur eight left">
						<img src="media/win8store.jpg" alt="A store featuring Windows 8 devices" class="media hidden left eight" loading="lazy"/>
					</div>

					<p>The radical departure from the familiar Start Menu and the emphasis on touch input led to a generally negative reception. Traditional desktop users found the interface changes challenging, especially without a Start Menu. The coexistence of the new Start Screen with the classic Desktop mode created a somewhat disjointed user experience.</p>

					<p>
					Released in October 2013, Windows 8.1 aimed to address user feedback and refine the Windows 8 experience.</p>

					<p>Windows 8.1 reintroduced the Start Button, providing a more familiar entry point for users. However, it did not restore the classic Start Menu. But users could now choose to boot directly to the Desktop, bypassing the Start Screen. Improved multitasking was also introduced with the ability to run multiple apps side by side in resizable windows.</p>

					<p>Despite the improvements in Windows 8.1, this version still faced challenges in winning over traditional desktop users. Many businesses and consumers chose to stick with Windows 7 due to the perceived complexities and learning curve associated with Windows 8.</p>

					<p>So, Microsoft mainly returned to the drawing board for their next version.</p>

					<p>Windows 8.1 received extended support until January 10, 2023, after which users were encouraged to transition to Windows 10 for continued security updates and feature enhancements.<br>

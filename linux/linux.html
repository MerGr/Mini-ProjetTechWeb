				<p>there was GNU, and before that there was Unix.
					Both centric to what makes Linux what it is today.</p>	
				
				<h2><em>The Unix Operating System</em></h2>

				<p>Released in 1970 by AT&T, Unix was a widely adopted operating system that featured the novel use of
					small, efficient and modular programs to achieve complex tasks.
					This practice of splitting functionality between programs and letting the user combine them has come to
					be known as the Unix Philosophy and is now a core part of the Linux experience.
				</p>

				<h2><em>The GNU Project</em></h2>

				<img src="media/gnu.png" class="media right hidden zero" loading="lazy" />

					<p>As great as Unix was, it was proprietary software. Most<br>
						manufacturers at the time began to use restrictive copyright to<br>
						limit access to source code. This posed a problem for people<br>
						who closely depended on such software; it meant if there was a<br>
						problem, bug or missing feature they could no longer fix it<br>
						themselves. this resulted in much frustration in hacker and<br>
						engineer circles.<br>
					</p>

					

					<p>
						Enter Richard Stallman: in 1983, a hacker in MIT's AI<br>
						laboratory and an operating systems developper, announces his<br>
						start on the GNU project; a unix like operating system that<br>
						features many of the same tools completely rewritten from<br>
						scratch, but as free software.<br>
						Along with his work on GNU, Stallman created the GNU Genreal Public License (GPL) to release it<br>
						with. A copyleft Licence that protects the right to distribute and modify free software.</p>

					<h2>By the early 1990, most of the GNU operating system was complete. That is, save for one important
						piece that proved to be very difficult to program: its kernel!</h2>

					80386 processor PC, Computer Science student Linus Torvalds began the work on his own kernel at the
					age of 25.<br><br>
					The first publicly released Linux was version *0.01* in 1991, described as a free minix-like kernel for
					the intel 386 architecture for personal computers.<br><br>
					Minix (mini Unix) is another Unix-like system, created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum for educational
					purposes. However, despite the source code being available, it restricted modification and distribution.<br><br>
					It was also the operating system that Linus used to create the first release of Linux.<br><br>
					*0.01* is considered a historical release today, but at the time it only supported a subset of hardware
					features, namely: the harddisk, screen, keyboard and serial lines, as well as missing some systemcall
					implementations such as mount and umount for example.</p>

					<p>The lack of a graphical environment that integrated with other applications like Windows, was felt by Mattias Ettrich, pushing him to the creation of the K Desktop Enviroment (KDE). And in 1998, KDE 1.0 was already a big step for the Linux Desktop. The design featured the now classic desktop with a set of default icons, a taskbar with application shortcuts and a small display for various information. There was a catch however, as the library KDE was built on was not compatible with GPL. This led to the creation of another desktop - GNOME. This time it's creators Miguel de Lcaza and Fererico Mena used the GTK toolkit, initially developped for the GIMP image editor, that was also licencsed under GPL. GNOME 1.0 released in 1999. Later in the year 2000, KDE was now GPL compliant as well thanks to the QT toolkit it used re-releasing under the GPLv2 licencse.</p>

					<p>Many other Desktop Environments, as well as Window Managers were created, this meant that Linux users had many options and a limitless freedom to decide how their desktop looks and functions that can&rsquo;t be found in other operating systems. KDE and GNOME remain the most widely used today due to their stability and adoption by many popular distributions.</p>

				<p>Despite Linux being free software, this didn't mean the developers working on it were doing it out of their own pockets. <br>Various companies realised the value in Linux and cashed in with significant resources to advance the kernel. Besides the large amounts of code contributed every release, other investments are in the form of cash donations to support developers and hardware donations to facilitate driver development. Formerly known as The Open Source Development Lab in 2000, The Linux Foundation has Linus Torvalds working full-time on their behalf developping the kernel. Among it&rsquo;s goals were promoting open source projects and accelerating their commercial adoption.</p>

				<p>s Linux gained more support from bigger companies such as IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Oracle and Red Hat, As well as seeing wider use and adoption in general, some parties at Microsoft felt threatened. In an internal Microsoft memo that was leaked in 1998, and later confirmed authentic by Microsoft, it discussed ways of competing with open source software. The memo suggests that one way in which open projects have seen wide adoption in the server market is through the use of standarized protocols, such protocols allow portability and freedom to chose or create different implementations of the same functionality. Vinod Valloppillil, the program manager at Microsoft who authored the memo suggests that open source software's flexibility in this domain can be combatted through extending the protocols, adding new protocols and lastly de-commoditizing said protocols and applications. Internally this policy has been nicked &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot; In 2009, Linux contributor Stephen Hemminger discovered GPL-Licensed open source bits of code used in breach of the GPL Licence by Microsoft in their Hyper-V network driver. Miscrosoft later contributed the code to the kernel after being compelled by Stephen to avoid legal action.</p>

				<p>What began as a hobby project for Linus Torvalds in 1991, has now grown beyond anyone&rsquo;s expectations at the time. Linux today makes up for a large portion of the software driving the world; In 2012, Red Hat became the first billion dollar open source company, pushing Linux to the buisness IT world as a commercial product. According to the Linux Foundation, in February 2015 over 80% of Linux kernel developers were paid.</p>

In general, Linux makes up about 2% of the personal computer OS market share, behind MacOS and Windows. For developers however, 47% use Linux in their machines. (Statista) Linux capabilities account for 39.2% of websites whose operating systems are known. (W3Techs) It is also the operating system of all the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputers.
